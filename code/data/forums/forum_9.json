Any thoughts?"}, {"author": "Evalion", "speak": "I already met the project thanks to this guy on twitter, he doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think highly of it. But hey, look at this way: bad publicity is still publicity . And he has been put in his place by various commenters, so you got that going for you.But seriously, good job man!"}, {"author": "Evalion", "speak": "BTW, is it possible for us to also make our own modules for this thing?"}, {"author": "colental", "speak": "Yeah I saw that - MalwareTech also tweeted about the project and he has 127k followers! My jaw was on the floor. He was critical of the quality of my code but the fact that someone of his stature would take notice of it and actually find it to be worth discussing + critiquing is crazy to me.Thanks for the response and any feedback is always welcome, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m still learning so I appreciate it!"}, {"author": "colental", "speak": "Yep, you definitely can write your own modules - just add them to the ./byob/modules/ directory and your modules can be remotely loaded into memory and directly imported into the currently running process, without writing anything to the disk!"}, {"author": "pry0cc", "speak": "I spoke about my thoughts on this project on twitter and I disagree with what a lot of people are saying.twitter.com    pry0cc / Ben (pry0cc)  I disagree with this. How can you expect to try and stop it if you can't learn how it works?I can imagine hundreds of labs this could be demoed in to train security researchers. Stop hating on kids trying to code. At the very least use this to make fingerprints. twitter.com/campuscodi/sta\u00e2\u20ac\u00a62:12 PM - 26 Jul 2018Learning this kind of thing is really useful to understanding how a C2 works. This is the entire thing of offensive security.Good job dude! This could even be used for engagements to demonstrate and test the impact of a potential botnet. Red Team simulations are everything to some top companies.I must say, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve read through the code and it looks pretty good man. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve used sensible function names, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve used functions, and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve used classes. All that stuff is good coding practice. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve seen a lot worse code in my time. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t listen to those tryna knock the hustle.Keep it up, man! You should check out IRC too. webchat.0x00sec.org / irc.0x00sec.org:6697+, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d all love to chat with you about it and ethics and stuff."}, {"author": "pry0cc", "speak": "In fact mate @colental, you should definitely do a write-up here on your tool. How to use it and how you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve designed it.That would be amazing."}, {"author": "Techno_Forg", "speak": "Damn dude\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 this is cool. Nice share. As pry0cc suggested, please do a write up. That would be awesome!"}, {"author": "Rot127", "speak": "Really nice tool! Can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t wait to look over and play with it!Besides that I totally agree with @pry0cc. A write up would be phenomenal! Especially, I would like to read more about your design and development process (e.g. what was your initial idea, how has it changed during development, what kind of problems did you encountered etc.)."}, {"author": "colental", "speak": "Thanks man, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tell you how much I appreciate you taking the time to look over the code and share your thoughts on it.I will definitely do a write up on how to use the tool and how I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve designed it (and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll check out IRC today too)!"}, {"author": "colental", "speak": "Awesome, thanks! I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m getting started on a write-up right now - hope to hear your thoughts on it after I post it!"}, {"author": "colental", "speak": "Glad to hear you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re interested in it man - I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m getting started on a write-up now!"}, {"author": "sergeantsploit", "speak": "I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll prolly read through your code and merge ZeroSpy with it. Good job and forget the haters.#Sergeant"}, {"author": "jl3", "speak": "Awesome project man, looking forward to reading your writeup! But what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the reason you went for python2 instead of 3?"}, {"author": "Kage", "speak": "Same here. Actually, I was pretty surprised when I saw that this project belongs to someone from 0x00sec. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll check the source code as soon as I can. Thanks for such a great project."}, {"author": "colental", "speak": "Good question - support for python3 may be implemented in the future, and my reasoning for choosing python2 may be flawed, so please let me know if I have over-looked something.One goal I had for this project was for it to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just work\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd without needing to install/configure anything - so basically the decision came down to the fact that, to the best of my knowledge, python2 is installed by default on Linux & macOS, where as python3 is not installed by default on any major platform that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m aware of."}, {"author": "MNG", "speak": "Well Done bro , I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made my own botnet long time ago and after reading your source code i think you really made it well .it would be fun to work with you bro just tell me if u need any help ."}, {"author": "jl3", "speak": "Well to my knowledge it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s installed on all major distros. Guess the exception is RHEL/CentOS and a lot of servers run that. So you have definitely made the right decision. Great work!"}, {"author": "fxbg", "speak": "reminds me of the early 00\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s when ryan1918 was around, we had pretty much huge chunks of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcplug n play\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 type code that noobs were just slapping together and running. (he was arrested btw, and the scene moved on)I think a project like this should help move security forward, it may not be the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pc\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd way of doing it, but as we all know the best way to get something fixed is to break it and show people it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broken.i like it. (but i dont like your haircut lol)"}, {"author": "m0nly666", "speak": "What do you all think is the best botnet available at the moment? would you consider this one?What are some of the harder botnets to detect ?"}]}
