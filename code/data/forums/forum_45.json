And to be fair, this IS the kind of tutorial you would see on l33t h4x0r sites like hackforums and the like. Also, I didn\u2019t see a tutorial anywhere on this thread, just screenshots and a link (that I didn\u2019t click).There is nothing wrong with \u201cmaking it look cool\u201d, although most of us (I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one) believe that less is better. I use a chromebook with Xenial for pen testing, all the tools on kali are pretty much found in aptitude, and those that aren\u2019t, install just as easy.Maybe some tutorials about using some of the tools?
