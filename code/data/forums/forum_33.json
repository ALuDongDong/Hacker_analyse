Today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s guest is the ever present pry0cc!But, first, a poll! Who do you want to see next time?fraqdtmricksanchezzSecsprtn0x00pfPhoenix7500voters1: Aight, so first off, can you tell me a bit about yourself, your infosec work, etc?SureI love infosec, and for work I primarily do pentesting, vulnerability scanning, consulting and a fair amount of R & Dthis involves testing new attack methods and developing inhouse tools related to our work2: What brought you into infosec? How\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d you get your start?Well for the longest period I was into development and systems administrationI did that as a hobby for about 3 years, and then I fell in love with LinuxNaturally, I started to become familiar with people who were involved in infosec (funnily enough through Google+), and I was curious about what you can actually doWhen I first began demystifying everything I was shocked how methods still worked3: What was your first hack?Hmmm\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I think it was probably some sort of MITM. I was a skid who had managed to install dsploit on android, and I felt so clever when I replaced images and created alert boxes on peoples mobile devices4: Do you have a degree?Nope!That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 3 years I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time to wasteHoweverI have watched all the CS50 videos5: What kinda tools do you typically work with now?Tools? Well mainly koadic and empire. We have a few in-house things we use, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not allowed to speak about those If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about shellsI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m using hashicorp packer, docker and kubernetes a lot for related things6: do you do any sort of programming?All the time!Bash, Ruby, Python, PHP. For libraries sinatra creeps its way in sometimes.Mainly automating things we donokogiri is love too7: for the pen-testing, vuln scanning, R&D, what areas would you advise an upcoming hacker to focus on?An upcoming hacker? If they want to do it professionally?HmmmI want to say: advice for people who are hobbyists and want to get into the industyRealize, to get an entry level job in security, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to be as good as you think you doAt least that was my problemI always thought that I had to be this amazing god-level hackerWhen you enter the industry, you realize that as long as you are happy to learn, getting an entry level job in security requires less knowledge than you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expectI would say, learn the buzzwords, SOW, NDA, CVA, PCI compliance, HIPPALearn security, and do CTF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122sAnd contribute to online communities like 0x00sec.org, and put them on your resume8: Do you have a favorite CTF?I really like the hackthebox.eu CTF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122sI bought a VIP subscription because I love them so muchThe difficult level indications are super useful for beginnersAnd they expose you to new exploit scenario\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all the time9: What was one of your biggest challenges?Self confidenceI never thought I was good enoughUntil I said, screw this, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m gonna work in security if it kills me.Then I realised I had more to offer than I ever thought10: What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s your favorite linux distro?I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realise I had to say: ArchBut, ubuntu for servers11: What do you do for fun? to kick back?Drive. I love driving, cleaning my car, hitting some nice twisty roads.I also like drinking and watching silly movies.CTF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s play a part tooSilly movies like, Die Hard 4\u00e2\u20ac\u0153What do you drive?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffdA Ford Fiesta ST-Line Red Edition1.0 Litre that produces 140 BHPIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a silly fun little hatchI plan on modifying it soon 12: What\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s color hat do you wear?#DCDCDC13: Okay.

I think my biggest downfall is not thinking I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m good enough as well.
