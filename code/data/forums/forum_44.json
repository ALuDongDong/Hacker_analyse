(It accept also only PIN or whetever kind of format except for text before the PIN number).There is also a local database with known common pins based on airgeddon project. To proceed with this method you have to leave blank the previous question => \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Insert Pin File (DEFAULT Pins in db):\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Warning! Try this at last chance Because Default Router\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PIN are few and the attack could fail.More info and project on GitHub check out:Summaryhttps://github.com/Virgula0/TheReaver"}, {"author": "pry0cc", "speak": "Do you find that WPS Pin cracking still works?I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not had success with this since 2013.

That is a social engineering attack. To explore it you can use some scripts such as Fluxion Linset or wifiphisher. Your comment is off topic"}, {"author": "Nitrax", "speak": "@chaos_knight\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s answer is far for being pointless. Indeed, whatever the method used, WPS Pin Cracking or social engineering, the end goal is still the same. Moreover, such SE attacks have a better chance to succeed in the wild. As @pry0cc said, and according to my own experience, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a while since this method is obsolete on modern AP.P.S: Do not see any animosity in my answer Best,Nitrax"}, {"author": "Virgula", "speak": "I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m using only WPS attack and I have an high success rate in attacks especially in Pixie Dust attack that TheReaver already have\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Social Engineering attacks are completely different from WPS attacks and in IMHO completely useless\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t compare them man\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6"}, {"author": "Ronin", "speak": "I thought the same as pry0cc, but I realized that if you travel to other countries like some in latin america they still use routers with more than 10 years so this is totally plausible, but the reality is that this type of attack is obsolete in face the new routers."}, {"author": "Virgula", "speak": "some modern routers are still affected by these vulnerabilities\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 trust me\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 if you have a WPS PIN you can crack whatever password of whatever router, you have to get only the wps pin except for router that only uses button for WPS. How can I say this? Read this example: my neighbor didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have wifi till 2 weeks ago\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 So he has installed a router recently, the router is a new type of NETGEAR router and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vulnerable both to PixieDust and 3wifi.stascorp.com pin generator.The real problem of modern routers is the AP rate limiting, a security option implemented to avoid attacks like this, but the program stop itself  if ap rate limiting is detected warning the user before exiting. Then you can delete by yourself pins already checked before leaving the remaining in order to test them when WPS will be unlocked"}, {"author": "system", "speak": "This topic was automatically closed after 30 days.
