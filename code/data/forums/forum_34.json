The battery drains pretty fast, but otherwise it is in very good conditions. Does anyone have a idea what project I might can realise with it? I don\u00b4t want to throw a perfectly fine computer away just because I don\u2019t need it anymore.Thanks"}, {"author": "oaktree", "speak": "@pry0cc put Arch on his!"}, {"author": "fxbg", "speak": "burn it live on youtube."}, {"author": "Ninja243", "speak": "What about hosting a site on it?That\u2019s what I\u2019ve done to my Pentium 4 tower"}, {"author": "pry0cc", "speak": "I actually have Late 2011, regardless, this era of MBP\u2019s run Arch amazing. I went one step further and installed an SSD as well, and boy is it nippy.You might find the battery is dying because it is old, mine is starting to go as well. You can get a brand new battery on ebay for these models for around 30 GBP.If you want to get fancy, you could mess around with this box as a hacking machine.
