Since it was a little while ago and a lot of people have already renewed their existing setup, got new hardware, jumped ship to Linux or MacOS (or even, gasp, windows), it would be so awesome to see what everybody is rocking and what works for everybody.We have about 30 days until this thread auto locks, so let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s try and see as many of your setups as possible! If you run Linux, Windows, MacOS, the whole community is really anxious to see what you got working for you, no matter how humble or extravagant, how little or how big, even just posting a screenshot would be awesome to see the wallpapers and things people are using on a daily basis.I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m so excited to see what you guys come up with!"}, {"author": "pry0cc", "speak": "To kickstart this, I am going to share my setup:This is the imgur album if you wish to peruse, but I am going to post it below anyway:[Album] This is Croc0, and this is my i3wm setup.Workspace 0: Autostarting tmux session with monitoring tools (used tmuxinator) Workspace 1: My terminal workspace when it is tidy. What I use for general terminal work. Workspace 1: My terminal workspace when it is messy. Workspace 2: Web workspace, I use this for all things web, usually just chrome, occasionally selenium makes its way onto here too  Workspace 3: My Code workspace, I use this for my coding projects and editing config files occasionally. Editor is sublime text with Base16 Eighties theme. Workspace 4: My file manager workspace, this is ranger, but thunar also defaults to this. Workspace 5: Ncmpcpp/Spotify, all my music playing apps default here. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been using spotify exclusively lately and it works really well. Workspace 8: My IRC/Discord/Slack workspace. Where I hang out in work slack, discord and the 0x00sec IRC. And now for my physical rig: I built this very recently, and the specs are as follows:Intel Core i7-8700K (CoffeeLake) 6 cores @ 3.7 GHz32GB Ram @ 3200MHzNvidia GTX 1070tiNXZT x62 AIO Water Cooler  2 monitors (Soon to be upgraded!) And a DX Racer Formula series. The keyboard is a Corsair K70 RGB. I might share my dotfiles, it depends if there is much demand for them. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very interested to see what everybody else has. @Nitrax, @fraq, @Evalion, @ricksanchez  I gotta see them setups!EDIT: @Evalion has requested I go into deeper detail about the build:https://pcpartpicker.com/list/q8kRKB Here is the PC part picker list.For airflow I have a frontmounted radiator with 2 140mm fans bring air in, and a single 140mm fan bringing air in through the top. I have 1 exhaust fan, also 140mm. I get a good positive air pressure with this build, and the CPU at about 30-40\u00e2\u20ac\u2122c.  It is so quiet and even quieter than my MacBook Pro. Under load you can hear the graphics card spinning up, which has these 3 fans https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515jAee9GsL.jpgIn hindsight, I would have gone with a blower type card with an exhaust, since this kicks heat out into the case rather than out the back. For a PSU, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just using a 650 watt fully modular Corsair PSU. This thing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fan doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even spin when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s idling, so it stays very quiet. I can run the whole rig idling/low load overnight and not even notice it."}, {"author": "ricksanchez", "speak": "You lost @pry0cc !Screenshot_2018-05-27_13-36-08.png4480x1440 779 KBI riced my rig to the absolute maximum."}, {"author": "pry0cc", "speak": "Well dude, wow.This is a super clean setup, I never see XFCE these days anymore.

First off, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve decided to install Debian again and this time I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m running lx as my DE (lxde), but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very light yet very customizable. On my Kali box, which is on another hard drive, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve decided to check out their lxde version which doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t require any live build scripts. Which is awesome\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 only issue I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve found with i3, is that I  have to use wpa_passphrase and wpa_supplicant to manually connect to my WiFi, which is a pain on a live boot. Anyways, if I could and have the time I would use i3wm.Anyways, here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ONE picture:Screenshot from 2018-05-27 09-49-28.jpg1920x1080 199 KBI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve made it beautiful and even changed the icon for the menu (which you can do btw)\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 no ugly fish or bird (?) as it is by default. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve also changed up the theme a bit and such. The limit is your imagination. Update: this is how my Kali box looks like:Screenshot from 2018-05-27 16-37-12.jpg1920x1080 141 KBAnyways, ~Cheers!P.S.
