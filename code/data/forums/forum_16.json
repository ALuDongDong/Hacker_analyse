Just being an 0x00sec member is enough for me <3There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no rank you must reach before joiningThe invitation is accepted from your team settings pageYou must have an account on HTB to get an invite, this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a case of me creating one for youP.S. Gonna use this opportunity to mention that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a huge fan of the write-ups for HTB published here because it means people can just blindly follow the steps and not understand what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s atually happening but still reap the rewards.
