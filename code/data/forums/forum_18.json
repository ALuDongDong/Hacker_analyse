Well now I am going to show you a little bit about researching individuals, and specifically those who work at a specific company.If you read the title, which I am sure you have, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll know that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to utilize LinkedIn for this. LinkedIn really is a very very very useful tool for enumerating users, and their emails.\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcGenerating\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 email addressesFrom my last article, I mentioned a tool called hunter.io, you can use it to search for company email addresses, and it even gives you a break down on what it thinks the current email structure is for a company.Stage 1 - Figure out the naming conventionsLets make up a fake company, say even google.com.Now lets assume we found a few emails with the format of hsimpson@google.com, and then we see another email, jsmith@gmail.com. We can soon start to get a feel for the kind of structure they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re using for emails, typically, {first initial}{lastname}@{companyname}.com, this could vary from organisation to organisation, but we can quickly come up with the naming convention, and then we can move onto stage 2.You can do this with hunter.io. Notice the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcmost common pattern\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 section?se7i.png781x303Stage 2 - Get the employees and Generate the EmailsThis is where LinkedIn plays nicely with us. If we can get a list of first and last names of everybody working at a company, we can then take that infomation and feed it into a python script, and generate email addresses from the convention.We can easily obtain these names through google dorking. Try my new tool GoogLinked, when coupled with ProxyDock (another shameless plug), you can scrape google all day with inpunity.seRh.png790x491One thing you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll want to do before you run this is modify the script, at the moment it contains Microsoft and microsoft.com as the arguments, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll want to modify it to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153company name\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, (as shown on linkedin), and the company email domain name. In the above example, I piped all results into a file, otherwise it will just dump them onto the standard output.Wow, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of email addresses, lets take a look and see what it came back with.So as you can see, there are a few generated email addresses. What this has done, under the hood, is using a Google Dork, captured the titles for each person that has microsoft listed under their portfolio as working or have worked. Then, it takes the format defined in the run_search() function.se7z.png708x395Notice that names.each section? Modify that depending on the format you discovered for the company (as we learned how to do in the section before). In this case, tarr[0] and tarr[-1] are firstname and lastname respectively. *This script is one I use personally, and so I modify it myself, if you want to make a PR to add custom functionality, feel free.* Note, things can get a bit whacky when middle names are introduced. So just know this is not a fool proof method.Now you have these emails, the world is your oyster. Pass them into weleakinfo.com? (See my last article).Bonus: Password SprayingIf you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re doing a pentest, you can use these emails to your advantage. Quite often, bruteforcing a companies email with a single email and 100k passwords, is your way to getting blocked by a SIEM, or even getting the account locked which impacts on production (if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a pentester you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll know the struggle :P), which we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want.One very unique way to acheive this, as taught to me by atoscher, is to try each email with a single password, such as Summer2018, or Fall2018. Many companies implement quarterly password rotation policies, in the hope to make passwords more unpredictable and secure. What actually ends up happening is people resort to using weaker passwords as they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember a new password every quarter. A very common usage of this is people using passwords like Summer2018.What else is cool about this method, is you can usually feed it through a load of VPN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, (cough ProxyDock cough), and then try legitmate services like gmail, microsoft link, sharepoint, the list can go on. Your chances of getting blocked, especially if you regularly rotate IP addresses, useragents, and individuals, is very low.That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all for this week 0x00\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ers! Stay tuned, next week I am going to bring you \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Active Recon - Deeper than Nmap\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, the name might change, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see.Make sure you drop a comment if you loved this article, please like it if I helped you, and share this everywhere.

Even looking at some of the emails, one of them has a comma in it. It would seem a bit redundant to pay for a service that generates fake emails or uses emails that are no longer a valid address.
