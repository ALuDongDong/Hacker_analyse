In that time we have rocketed up to 113th place on the team leader-board (from 350th). This is no small accomplishment. I do, however, think we can do even better and get on the Top 100 leaderboard. So from here on out, and if I can remember to,  I will be posting a weekly challenge box for us all to root. (With the exception of our 0x00sec CTF weeks).In addition to this; our very own @pry0cc has managed to partner us up with HackTheBox which should serve as even more incentive.So without further ado, I present this weeks post:WaldoThread Rules:No SpoilersNo SpoilersIf you need to ask a question, please use [spoiler][/spoiler] tags if you think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll reveal informationHints are allowed if they are vague, and oddly cryptic. Paint an Escher painting with your wordsFeel free to post that you pwned a box, but no write-ups. NadaAsking for help without effort on your part will be met with near fatal doses of sarcasmN.B:I will be watching the HTB twitter to know what challenges are being decommissioned so we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lose forward progress in our rankings. They release this info on every 6-8 days so this post will always be on a Thursday/Friday. This is no guarantee however as they might decommission the week after. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a numbers game so if we keep pwning we keep ranking up.If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re interested in joining our HTB Team, please read more here."}, {"author": "clarkee", "speak": "All done"}, {"author": "pry0cc", "speak": "Dude, this is amazing!!You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re awesome for organising this, I love this initiative I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to do Waldo right now!EDIT: Rooted.

I would strongly advise not reading the forums on HTB about Waldo, they are very spoilery last I checked.If anyone has any questions, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be happy to point you in the right direction, though bear in mind I will be taking @0x6e756c6c\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advice about painting an Escher painting\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Good luck everyone, hope you learn something!"}, {"author": "pry0cc", "speak": "Awesome! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so cool to see that the co-author is a member here.I must say, privesc is a bitch, and I have massively mixed emotions at whoever came up with that mechanism Let us know when you make another box, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll feature it here assuming it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not too extreme like fighter, not yet anyway"}, {"author": "capnspacehook", "speak": "Haha yeah\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the first part of privesc was mostly my design, and the last bit was strawman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Privesc is \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6fun, not gonna lie  sorry not sorryNo problem! Not planning any boxes at the moment, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll let you know if I create one!"}, {"author": "occupi", "speak": "Can I ask how you got into designing a box for HTB? Are you in the industry? Have you owned a bunch already and wanted a new challenge? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m really curious!"}, {"author": "capnspacehook", "speak": "So, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not actually in industry, yet. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m currently a college student, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m hoping to graduate and get a job in industry next May.I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve owned a few easier boxes already, but haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t had time to tackle a lot of the more difficult ones yet. My friend strawman on HTB (the other co-creator) asked me to preview a box he was creating for HTB. At the time, Waldo was very alpha, and a lot easier compared to what it was now. So I offered to help him and we set out testing and tweaking, and adding difficulty to the box. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the main creator, he did more of the work and the box was his idea.I thought it was really interesting, fun, and something that would look really good on my resume. So I helped him over the course of the next few weeks until we submitted it.Creating a box makes you think about both sides of the coin, both from an attacker and defender view.  I would highly recommend creating boxes to anyone that wants to get into the industry or wants to better their craft."}, {"author": "occupi", "speak": "Fantastic response, thank you so much!"}, {"author": "0x6e756c6c", "speak": "Just popped it last night. Getting user was fun. Privesc was definitely something.Amazing stuff @capnspacehook. I mean I hate you but thanks."}]}
