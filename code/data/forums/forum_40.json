The 0x00sec drone is on the way to be accomplished right? So why not understand how drones generally work and even build your own.Disclaimer: All the information provided in this article is pure self-researching, so if I got something wrong please let me know. Also some constructive criticism is always welcomed.What is a droneAccording to wikipedia a drone is:An unmanned aerial vehicle ( UAV ), commonly known as a drone , is an aircraft without a human pilot aboard. UAVs are a component of an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) which include a UAV, a ground-based controller, and a system of communications between the two. The flight of UAVs may operate with various degrees of autonomy: either under remote control by a human operator or autonomously by onboard computers.Typically an unmanned aircraft is made of light composite materials to reduce weight and increase maneuverability.There are multiple types of drones. Here are some of them:Number of PropellersSizeRangeEquipmentTricopterNano DronesClose Range DronesDrones with CameraQuadcopterMini DronesShort Range DronesDrones with FPVHexacopterRegular Size DronesMid-Range DronesDrones with GPSOctocopterLarge DronesEndurance DronesDrones with stabilizersAs you can see, they can be categorized by range, size, number of propellers, etc. Of course, there are out there military drones, space drones, etc. But I mainly discuss here about types you can build and are out for the public to buy.For the next part of the article, I will be talking only about FPV drones that are usually quadcopters.The anatomy of a droneIn order to start building a drone, you will first need to understand what each component does. I will take each component apart and explain what is its role, but before that, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s look at a basic overview of a basic FPV drone:FPV-Drone-Anatomy-1.jpg1500x1085 599 KBYou can think of this as 3 main parts:The FPV system consists of video streaming components such as: camera, FPV goggles and video transmitter.The Flight system is helping the drone to actually fly (Flight Controller, motors, ESC, propeller, etc).The Power system is made of components that distribute electrical power to the other components of the drone in order to make it work (PDB, Battery).The FPV systemAs said earlier, the FPV system consists of a camera, FPV goggles and a video transmitter. Basically the camera mounted on your drone capture a video. This is sent back with the help of the video transmitter by broadcasting a signal wirelessly. This signal is caught by your video receiver, on the goggles, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shown onto the screen.The flight systemThe flight system is composed of the following components: flight controller, R/C controller, R/C receiver, motors, ESCs and propellers. The way it works is the following:The pilot is moving the joystick on the R/C controller.That signal is sent to the R/C receiver wirelessly.The R/C receiver then is forwarding the signal to the flight controller.The flight controller interprets these commands, calculates what speed each motor should have and send it to the ESCs.The ESCs are converting this signal to voltage and sends it to the motors.The motors now are producing the needed thrust to move the drone the way you wanted.Drone componentsLet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s start analyzing each of the components and see exactly what is the role for each of them.FrameThis is the basic building block of a drone. It acts as a skeleton in which all of the other components are placed in such a manner that they uniformly distribute the drone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s center of gravity. Usually it needs to be as strong as possible but also as light as possible. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why they are generally made of carbon fiber.They come in different styles and sizes but all have the same basic job.This component will also determine what propeller size you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to use. You can determine that by the frame\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s size (the size of a frame is just the distance between the diagonal length (in mm) from the middle of one motor to the middle of the motor directly diagonal to it).PropellersPropellers are clove like blades structured to create a difference in air pressure. When in motion, they cut through the air creating difference in pressure between the top of the motors and the bottom. The top side is characterized by low pressure as compared to the bottom causing the drone to lift into the air.The standard way to name propellers is 5x4x4. This means you have a 5 inch propeller with a pitch of 4 inches and there are 4 blades.50690_0.jpg599x600 91.3 KBMotorsMotors are some of the most important components. They are the driving force of the drone and they provide thrust. Thus being crucial for the drone control in terms of direction and for correct propeller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rotation. Still, the number of motors should be the same as the number of propellers.Choosing the right motor is pretty important for the efficiency of the drone. Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s take a look at a motor name found in the wild: DYS Samguk Series Wei 2207 2600kv Motor. The first number we encounter is 2207. This is specifying the dimensions of the motor, the motor is 22mm in diameter and have a 7mm height.For more information on motors you can have a look at these resources:Brushless motorsChoosing the right motorst-motor-air-40-2450kv-big.jpg1024x1024 147 KBElectronic Speed Controller (ESC)This is an electronic control board that varies the motor speed. To make this possible, the ESC is taking commands from the Flight Controller and translate them into power to the motors. Thus every motor needs it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own ESC.It also acts as a dynamic brake. The component helps the ground pilot to approximate the height at which the drone is running in.fpv-0052-s1.png800x600 319 KBFlight ControllerThe Flight Controller is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153brain\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of the drone and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where all the magic happens. It interprets input from receiver, GPS module, battery monitor, IMU and other onboard sensors. It regulates motor speeds, via ESCs, to provide steering, as well as triggering cameras or other payloads. It controls autopilot, waypoints, follow me, failsafe and many other autonomous functions.  The flight controller is central to the whole functioning of your drone.It also determines and calculates the drone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s altitude in respect to the amount of power it consumes.spracing-flight-controller-acro_3.jpg1000x1000 159 KBPower Distribution Board (PDB)The PDB job is simply to distribute the power from the battery to the other relevant components such as: ESCs, Flight Controllers, VTX, FPV cam, Receiver, LEDs, etc hence the name Power Distribution Board.Most of today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s PDB boards include BECs. A BEC stands for Battery Elimination Circuit. It basically represents a voltage regulator. If a voltage regulator would not be in place, you could easily burn out the other components by providing more voltage than the specific component can handle.matek-pdb-xt60-power-hub-distribution-board.jpg1575x1575 122 KBThe batteryNow we get to the component that provides the power to your drone \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the battery. Most drones use Lithium polymer (LiPo) batteries because they offer the best combination of energy density, power density, and lifetime on the market.They are made by more cells packed together. So by adding more cells you add more voltage.fpv-racing-drones-tattu-1400mah-111v-45c-3s1p-lipo-battery-pack.jpg800x800 33.6 KBR/C ReceiverOften a standard r/c radio receiver unit. The minimum number of channels needed to control a quad is 4, but 5 is usually recommended.R/C ControllerThe Controller is what the pilot holds in the hands and send signals to the drone by playing with the joysticks.Flysky-FSi6-2.jpg1000x1000 86.8 KBFPV cameraFPV cameras are designed to have the lowest possible latency (the time it takes for it to capture a frame and send it back to you). Most FPV cameras do NOT provide HD output however as this increases the latency of the feed which is disastrous for FPV flying.Video TransmitterThe camera would be useless without a video transmitter. This component is simply broadcasting the video feed back to the goggles.fpv-camera-vtx-video-transmitter-connection.jpg1080x866 78.9 KBOther drone technologiesRadar Positioning & Return HomeMany of the latest drones have dual Global Navigational Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as GPS and GLONASS.The radar technology in the drone will signal the following on the remote controller display;signal that enough drone GNSS satellites have been detected and the drone is ready to fldisplay the current position and location  of the drone in relation to the pilotrecord the home point for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcReturn To Home\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 safety featureObstacle Detection And Collision Avoidance TechnologyMany drones are now equipped with collision avoidance systems. These drone vision systems use obstacle detection sensors to scan the surroundings, while software algorithms and SLAM technology produce the images into 3D maps allowing the flight controller to sense and avoid the object.Internal Compass & Failsafe FunctionAllows the UAV and remote control system to know exactly its flight location.  Calibration of the Compass is required to set a home point.  The home point is the location where the drone will return to in case of loss of signal between the drone and the remote control system.  This is also know as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fail-safe function\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.No Fly ZoneActually a lot of the already made drones out there waited to be sold include a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No Fly Zone\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd feature  to increase flight safety and prevent accidental flights in restricted areas.That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why you better build your own  ConclusionDrone technologies have evolved significantly in the past few years. Thus, a lot of new technologies are on the way and a lot of improvements are waiting to be made. I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a necessary thing you need to understand nowadays because they will soon be everywhere. From the Security view, this is a cool thing and a terrifying one at the same time because they are not so secure, so you can easily take control of one. But, you can also create drones for operations with a specific task in mind. A great example is the 0x00sec drone !It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty expensive to build your own but you will learn a lot and have a great experience.I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry that I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t contributed to the community for a while and I have been inactive for so long, but now I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m back and hope we can continue to spread knowledge and wisdom.Cya on the IRC and thanks for reading !"}, {"author": "Arian1", "speak": "Actually, quite a read, mate.
