From there if it was using a known attack vector[1] it would be patched, of course the engine that detected that would still remain on that system for a few days to expand the inbound detected attack pool.If the system is embedded and read only or such, the device would attempt to be destroyed to remove it as a threat from the internet.Generally what I am suggesting building is a blue team honey pot with red team extensions Let me know your thoughts![1] A known attack vector that was used to gain access to the machine that we are now connected to! (In most cases this should be simple to diagnose the art is removing whatever malware was installed via it)"}, {"author": "Nanobyte", "speak": "Loved your idea !
