This is by no means complete and if some links are a repeat\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 please edit it at your leisure.Disclaimer: All content is at your own risk not mine. If you get arrested by the three-letter-organizations, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come whining to me.#Books:Everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nightmare\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 BOOKS!!! READING!!! Well, if you want to get into hacking/security/computers/whatever-hell-you-want-to-call-it, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to read. These are just a couple of books that I could think of and I found among my collection that are useful. A couple I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t add since they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so good.Hacking: The Art of Exploitation - Ok, this book is by far one of my favorites. Covering basically the true nature of hacking and the art.C++ Programming from problem analysis to program design, 6th edition - This was suggested by a good acquittance of mine that shall be unnamed.C++ for Dummies - Ok, this book isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t such a great read after a bit, but still a really great start. This was how I got started with coding.CompTIA A+ - This was also suggested by a unnamed acquittance of mine. Really good start for those that wish to get into computers.The Art of Intrusion - Kevin Mitnick is by far one of the greatest hackers of his time (although he was a skid, preferred to SE more than anything). This book is a series of real life stories of hackers, well, hacking. This is a really good read if you can read it all. Check your local library for a copy if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to pay 10 dollars for it.#Websites/Blogs:The way I started hacking is through Google which is where I found several really great beginner friendly websites and blogs. A couple you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve probably heard of, but a couple not so much. This section is dedicated to sharing my findings.Xeus Hacks - First thing on this list is what got me hooked with hacking, Xeus Hacks\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 this is actually a amazing resource of tutorials which have lead me to other sites throughout the internet. This site is slightly outdated in terms of the material, but still good.NirSoft - This site couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been found without my good old friend, Xeus\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 This is actually a pretty cool website with a bunch of software.Github - No, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not trolling. Github is a amazing place to go and find some pretty sweet resources and projects. For example, SecLists. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll leave it at that.Shell-Storm - This site I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve recently just found as of this writing and realized how pretty sweet it is.#0x00sec Links:Ok so this section is dedicated primarily to this forum in general. Why? Maybe because I have a lot of people to thank for helping me grow as a person and as a Computer Science nerd. This section is dedicated to them and my thanks, primarily the Programming for Wannabes series by @0x00pf.Programming for Wannabes. Part I - I love how this starts out as a series. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lot of material here to cover that I just couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but read it a while back.Programming for Wannabes. Part II - As always, you gotta follow up with another great read.Programming for Wannabes. Part II and a Half - This one I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t remember reading, but I presume it is a nice read.Programming for Wannabees. Part III. Your first Shell Code - I love this post because it gets into shellcode which is awesome and since I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m currently studying shellcode (ish), this post is really helpful. Another great reference for shellcode is by @IoTh1nkN0t,Linux Shellcoding (Part 1.0) Exploit Development    As promised, here is the shellcode tutorial once again RequirementsAlright so this isn't going to be msfvenom tutorial. (shellcodes are payloads).  This tutorial will focus on writing shellcodes using Assembly. Knowledge of C and Assembly is highly recommend. Also knowing how the stack works is a big plus. Memory SegmentsWhen a program is run it is loaded in the RAM. Normally 5 segments are used in programs: The stack segment (For function calls (dynamic)).The heap segment (For dyna\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6  STELF - Ok, so STELF is a pretty dope shell written by @Joe_Schmoe and I would like to thank him for working on this for so long. He showed me the framework version a while back when I was a noob and since than I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve fallen in love with this shell. The source is in gitlab.IoT Malware - Last year I was interested in Mirai which is a really cool malware at first. It turns out all it does it take advantage of weak passwords and it was released to Hack Forums where a lot of skids reside in (not saying I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a skid, but I think you guys can get a idea what I mean). For a bit I managed to find the source code on github and was trying to study it. I failed, but still worth posting on this wiki.Hacking Facebook Accounts | setoolkit - I did this out of sheer whim because well\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 setoolkit is a really nice tool if used correctly. This post is written by @the_c0nd0r and I shall note that this tutorial is a really skid orientated post, but still nice (I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m just joking (really nice post)).YARA Rules - Really cool post on YARA rules, even though I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand half of it. Really well organized and well done. Cudos goes to @REal0day .#Cryptocurrency:Ok so this is for btc, xmr, whatever-hell-you-want-to-mine resources. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how to mine using pools or clicking a button use your good friend:google.nlGoogleDag 13 van de doodle-sneeuwspelletjes \u00e2\ufffd\u201e #GoogleDoodleXMR Web Miner - This one I found out of sheer boredom at school. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if it works since I never ran it long enough to get a payout. Please try it out at your own risk.mmpool - A relatively simple mmpool. All you do is create a username and add your BTC Address. There are options for other crypto-currency, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve mainly used it for BTC. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need a Block Erupter in order to have any success since it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t possible to mine using your CPU these days. Amazon has a great collection:amazon.comAmazon.com: ASIC Miner Block Erupter USB Bitcoin 333 MH/s BTC: Computers & AccessoriesMoon Faucet - This is a REALLY good faucet. Instead of only allowing you to claim once per hour\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Moon Faucet allows you to claim anytime. I should note that the longer you wait the less currency you accumulate, but you can still claim anytime.#Torrents:This section is not at all illegal. Why? Maybe because I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like putting more money in the pockets of the assholes you call \u00e2\u20ac\u0153celebs\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This is where I use torrents.The Pirate Bay - Despite the stupid rumors of, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The FBI shutting down TPB\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t true at all. Really great torrent site and this is my primary source for most of my music and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153stuff\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.Transmission - This isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a torrent site but instead a torrent downloader. I use this on my Debian Linux Distribution running GNOME.#Conclusion:Please edit as much as you want or get rid of it eternally\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I just posted this because I wanted to and I hope these references are helpful.\u00e2\u20ac\u201cTechno Forg\u00e2\u20ac\u201c"}, {"author": "jack_lucius", "speak": "it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cool,thanks for your share."}, {"author": "wast", "speak": "Bookmarked, thank you."}, {"author": "direnjie", "speak": "nice share\u00ef\u00bc\ufffd\u00ef\u00bc\ufffd\u00ef\u00bc\ufffd\u00ef\u00bc\ufffd\u00ef\u00bc\ufffd\u00ef\u00bc\ufffd\u00ef\u00bc\ufffd\u00ef\u00bc\ufffd\u00ef\u00bc\ufffd\u00ef\u00bc\ufffd"}, {"author": "_py", "speak": ""}]}
